# Salesforce
Introduction:
Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers. 
Salesforce has everything you need to run your business from anywhere. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud. 

# Object
Salesforce objects are database tables that permit you to store data that is specific to an organization. What are the types of Salesforce objects 
Salesforce objects are of two types: 
Standard Objects: Standard objects are the kind of objects that are provided by salesforce.com such as users, contracts, reports, dashboards, etc. 
Custom Objects: Custom objects are those objects that are created by users. They supply information that is unique and essential to their organization. They are the heart of any application and provide a structure for sharing data.
# Tabs
A tab is like a user interface that is used to build records for objects and to view the records in the objects.
Types of Tabs:
Custom Tabs
Custom object tabs are the user interface for custom applications that you build in salesforce.com. They look and behave like standard salesforce.com tabs such as accounts, contacts, and opportunities.
Web Tabs
Web Tabs are custom tabs that display web content or applications embedded in the salesforce.com window. Web tabs make it easier for your users to quickly access content and applications they frequently use without leaving the salesforce.com application.
Visualforce Tabs
Visualforce Tabs are custom tabs that display a Visualforce page. Visualforce tabs look and behave like standard salesforce.com tabs such as accounts, contacts, and opportunities.
Lightning Component Tabs
Lightning Component tabs allow you to add Lightning components to the navigation menu in Lightning Experience and the mobile app.
Lightning Page Tabs
Lightning Page Tabs let you add Lightning Pages to the mobile app navigation menu.
Lightning Page tabs don't work like other custom tabs. Once created, they don't show up on the All Tabs page when you click the Plus icon that appears to the right of your current tabs. Lightning Page tabs also don't show up in the Available Tabs list when you customize the tabs for your apps.
# The Lightning App
An app is a collection of items that work together to serve a particular function. In Lightning Experience, Lightning apps gives users access to sets of objects, tabs, and other items all in one convenient bundle in the navigation bar. 
Lightning apps let you brand your apps with a custom color and logo. You can even include a utility bar and Lightning page tabs in your Lightning app. Members of your org can work more efficiently by easily switching between apps. 
# Fields
When we talk about Salesforce, Fields represent the data stored in the columns of a relational database. It can hold any valuable information that you require for a specific object. Hence, the overall searching, deletion, and editing of the records become simpler and quicker. 
Types of Fields :
Standard Fields 
Custom Fields 
Standard Fields: 
As the name suggests, the Standard Fields are the predefined fields in Salesforce that perform a standard task. The main point is that you can’t simply delete a Standard Field until it is a non-required standard field. Otherwise, users have the option to delete them at any point from the application freely. Moreover, we have some fields that you will find common in every Salesforce application. They are, 
Custom Fields: 
On the other side of the coin, Custom Fields are highly flexible, and users can change them according to requirements. Moreover, each organiser or company can use them if necessary. It means you need not always include them in the records, unlike Standard fields. Hence, the final decision depends on the user, and he can add/remove Custom Fields of any given form.
# Profiles
A profile is a group/collection of settings and permissions that define what a user can do in salesforce. Profile controls “Object permissions, Field permissions, User permissions, Tab settings, App settings, Apex class access, Visualforce page access, Page layouts, Record Types, Login hours & Login IP ranges. You can define profiles by the user's job function. For example System Administrator, Developer, Sales Representative. 
Types of profiles in salesforce 
Standard profiles: 
By default salesforce provides below standard profiles. 
Contract Manager
Read Only
Marketing User
Solutions Manager
Standard User
System Administrator.
We cannot deleted standard ones 
Each of these standard ones includes a default set of permissions for all of the standard objects available on the platform. 
Custom Profiles: 
Custom ones defined by us. 
They can be deleted if there are no users assigned with that particular one.
